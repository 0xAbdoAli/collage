## Module 01: Computer Networks and the Internet
<hr>

### Overview/roadmap:

• What is the Internet? What is a protocol?

• Network edge: hosts, access network, 
physical media

• Network core: packet/circuit switching, 
internet structure

• Performance: loss, delay, throughput

• Protocol layers, service models

• Security

• History

<hr>

### The Internet

Billions of connected 
computing devices:

▪ hosts = end systems 

▪ running network apps at 
Internet’s “edge”

#### Packet switches: forward 
packets (chunks of data) => routers, switches

#### Communication links
▪ fiber, copper, radio, satellite

 transmission rate: bandwidth

#### Networks
▪ collection of devices, routers, 
links: managed by an organization

### ▪ Internet standards
• RFC: Request for Comments

• IETF: Internet Engineering Task 
Force

### Protocols : 
define the format, order of 
messages sent and received among 
network entities, and actions taken
on message transmission, receipt

## Access Network

<hr>

### Access Technologies :-

- xDSL
- FTTx
- Wireless Access
- LAN
- HFC

### What to look for: 
▪ transmission rate (bits per second) of 
access network?

▪ shared or dedicated access among users?


## Access networks: cable-based access

#### frequency division multiplexing (FDM): different channels transmitted in different frequency bands

### ▪ HFC: hybrid fiber coax
• asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps – 1.2 Gbps downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps 
upstream transmission rate

### ▪ network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
• homes share access network to cable headend

## Access networks: digital subscriber line (DSL)

▪ use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM

• data over DSL phone line goes to Internet

• voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net

▪ 24-52 Mbps dedicated downstream transmission rate 

▪ 3.5-16 Mbps dedicated upstream transmission rate
